# We use the ir-metadata standard to describe and process runs.
# The fields below are mandatory, you can add additional metadata if you like.
# There are two libraries that automate and simplify tracking of experimental metadata that you can use optionally:
#
#   - The metadata module of [repro_eval](https://www.ir-metadata.org/software/):
#     Tracks the platform and implementation of your experiments.
#
#   - The [tirex_tracker](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker/):
#     Tracks the platform, implementation, and resources (e.g., CPU, GPU, RAM, emissions, etc.) of your experiments.
#
# See https://www.ir-metadata.org for more details.
