I'll second that retardicon, what Ukrainians are going through is beyond my comprehension and I get sick when I try to put myself there.
While I understand the reasoning behind my country's decision to deny certain weapons/defenses I feel it's morally wrong.
It's a decision based on fear and what ifs vs the reality on the ground.
Ukraine is doing the US a huge solid that will pay off for decades, paid by Ukrainian blood and sweat.
That's irreplaceable and worth more than any weapon we could give.
I feel we paid Ukraine pennies on the dollar to decimate Russia giving what we have.
I cannot effectively argue my position and won't.
I have no degree or anything other than my gut and I could be very wrong.
All I know is everyday Ukraine is in my thoughts and I wish that did something.
NATO Parliamentary Assembly recognizes Russia as ‘terrorist state,’ calls for special tribunal creation.
Why that many?
The worship of "strenh" (violence) is very strong in Russia.
The learned helplessness, doing what your fucking told no matter what, is very strong in Russia.
So the west probably needs to up the arms ante and get those 1.2-3.4 million Russians into their cold dark sunflower future.
