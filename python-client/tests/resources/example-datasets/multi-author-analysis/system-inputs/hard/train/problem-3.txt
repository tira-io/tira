A company requiring their employees to do it vs the government mandating companies to require it are very different things though.
I gave an example of how a company requiring anything, even if it's stupid, from its employees, is very different from a country enforcing or demanding those policies be enforced.
It's not at all inconsistent like the user was implying.
If the government starts forcing businesses (even if "just" through refusing access to government services or funds) to enforce a dress code, then I'll be fully opposed.
No, it's the US.
Indian employees who returned back home or were never in the US to begin with had to present vaccination certificates or get suspended.
Vaccines weren't available for the most part, so most either came back to get vaccinated and then went back or risked getting suspended (which quite a few did).
Trump tried to get people to vaccinate because he saw the development of a vaccine as his accomplishment and didn't understand why they wouldn't listen to him.
After him promoting every conspiracy theory on the planet, they turned on him when he was doing the right thing.
