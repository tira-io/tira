Lula is a center-leftist, pro-workers' rights guy who was arrested on made up charges.
One guy accused him of receiving bribes to get a lighter sentence in a plea deal, then retracted his statement later.
Meanwhile, the judge who sentenced Lula was working directly with the prosecuting team (which goes against the Brazilian constitution), and even supported Bolsonaro in this election, despite saying he wouldn't support either side beforehand.
He was also a minister of justice during Bolsonaro's administration, before falling off with the fascist, only to support him again later for this election.
The rest of the world should support all these countries financially to retain their rainforest, and support their people.
This should have been put in place years ago.
It is good.
If you want to keep tree cutting to sustainable levels while not losing hundreds of millions from not touching all the other trees, then the price of the wood available on the market needs to go up.
This is one way to ensure it, and it is gonna be done as part of the conservation efforts.
