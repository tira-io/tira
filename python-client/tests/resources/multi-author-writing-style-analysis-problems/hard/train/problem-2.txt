See Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle for example...
Early SciFi was wild, there's a whole crazy (but very interesting) archive out there about the actual physics of atomic rockets and physically accurate space warfare...
Then of course there's 60s/70s SciFi where we had huge spaceships being catapulted into orbit by exploding a succession of nuclear bombs underneath them...
Also since in space a nuclear explosion has nothing to actually push against, all it will amount to is a big EMP pulse.
The risky part is getting the reactors safely into space, or at least far enough away to not cause widespread fallout from an exploded rocket.
“Just” need to make sure the radioactive parts per million is low enough (depends on the altitude of the explosion and the amount of radioactive material onboard).
I mean, the reactors would never blow up, they’d melt down and spread radiation over a wide area, but that’s a moot point.
Before the average person reads this and freaks out, nuclear rockets are ONLY used in space (which is already filled with deadly radiation).
They are not used to launch rockets inside the Earth’s atmosphere.
