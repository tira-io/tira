To answer your question, easily tens of thousands of soldiers.
No one knows the exact number of course.
Ukrainians are taking heavy losses as well, but because they are the defenders like multitudes less than Russia is taking.
Yup... the fact that Russia's big offensive has amounted to nothing really changing shows that Ukraine's defenses are simply too strong for Russia to overcome.
On the other hand, RfU reports tactical success in Vuhledar: Ukraine have reversed all Russian advance from January, controlling territory all the way to Pavlivka and Myskil's'ke.
My initial read was "if Putin thinks he will lose Crimea, then he would be willing to trade Crimea (while it has value) in exchange for lifting of sanctions and ending the war".
I think this is a good thing if it saves Ukrainian lives, and Ukraine restores it's territorial sovereignty.
"We need to think about how we will protect the security of Ukraine in the future.
This is a conversation that we should start already, because the summit in Vilnius is a good place to finish it.
".
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has categorically ruled out any territorial losses for his country, following the announcement of a Chinese peace plan.
It is in Ukraine's interest that China plays a role in the search for peace, but its territorial integrity is not negotiable, Kuleba said at MSC2023.
â€œNo concessions, no compromise is possible with regard to the territorial integrity of Ukraine or any other nation in the world,".
