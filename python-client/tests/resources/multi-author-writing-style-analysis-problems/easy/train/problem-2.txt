Do you understand what you are saying here?
This would be reasonable if WW3 wasn't one of the very possible and very few outcomes and if Ukraine winning the war with Russia's unconditional surrender was actually a possible outcome.
What you are saying is you think WW3 or Ukrainians being genocided completely is better than making concessions.
Concessions and peace negotiations should absolutely, positively be on the table.
You do not want war.
Ask someone who has seen war if war is a noble or fun thing to be a part of.
Not to continue ranting on this point, but do you want a frag grenade dropped on you by a drone while you are shitting in a frozen ditch?
That's what is happening right now to soldiers on both sides in Ukraine.
You especially do not war with a nuclear power headed by a psychopath who doesn't give a fuck and wishes to re-implement a Russian empire by whatever means possible.
Exactly.
Right now Ukraine is holding its own against Russia.
That's a small miracle even with Western equipment.
If they give Putin a chance to recuperate he'll mass forces and steamroll them no matter the cost in Russian soldiers lives.
