Now let’s look at the current tensions most of the US public was been neutral or unfriendly to iran(not to the point of let’s go to war) Iraq since the invasion has proven willing to fight for their country as shown in the fight against ISIS, as well as long standing American ties with the Kurds since we entered the region in 2001(until trump fucked it up) now the Kurdish American relations are extremely mendable especially if Iranian troops enter their lands so there is one nation and one ethnic group that are willing to fight and let’s be real here with the devestation from the last war with Iran I doubt there is much good will on top of that this means the US doesn’t have to worry about staging as we have Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi to send troops from as well as a constant slew of ships in the area, second Iran is under extreme turmoil with the protests and the government shooting people in the streets which means if there is direct US involvement and we don’t stop at the border and force a peace we already have local support on the ground and this includes the people, politicians and government employees who support them but remain silent for their safety and those who see opportunities of a post Islamic Iran making the job a lot easier with a surplus of bureaucrats clamoring for a job, now I will admit the US fucked this up in Iraq with banning any Baathist party officials office in Iraq however Iraq never had dissent at this scale which means even the most harsh screening for a post war government will give them plenty of people.
Yes, it would be an invitation by Israel, Saudi and the US to come to Kurdistan aid, destroy Iranian nuclear facilities and legitimize it by protecting freedom in Iraqi Kurdistan.
