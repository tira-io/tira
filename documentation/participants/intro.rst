.. rubric:: Integrations

For reproducibility and confidentiality reasons, all TIRA submissions are sandboxed and can not access the internet. But we created TIRA integrations for important libraries so that you don't have to refrain from using them. These integrations are designed to be unintrusive small changes and allow your code to run inside and outside the sandbox.
