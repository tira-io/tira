  abstract: >-
    A major obstacle to the long-term impact of most shared
    tasks is their lack of reproducibility. Often only the
    test collections and the papers of the organizers and
    participants are published. Third parties who want to
    independently evaluate the state of the art for a task on
    other data must re-implement the participants’ software.
    The tools developed to collect software from participants
    in shared tasks only partially verify its reliability at
    the time of submission, much less long-term, and do not
    enable third parties to reuse it later. We have overhauled
    the TIRA Integrated Research Architecture to address all
    of these issues. The new version simplifies task setup for
    organizers and software submission for participants,
    scales from a local computer to the cloud, supports
    on-demand resource allocation up to parallel CPU and GPU
    processing, and enables export for local reproduction with
    just a few lines of code. This is achieved by implementing
    the TIRA protocol with an industry-standard continuous
    integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Git,
    Docker, and Kubernetes.
