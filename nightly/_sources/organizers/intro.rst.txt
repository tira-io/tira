============

Why TIRA?
---------

.. grid:: 1 2 3 3
   :margin: 4 4 0 0
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`light-bulb` Simple
    
      Solving the shared task should be the hard part of a submission.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`dependabot` Automated
      
      Automatically evaluate and track participants' submissions.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`eye-closed` Confidential

      Evaluate submissions automatically and without publishing the test data.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`sync` Repeatable
    
      Via containerization, we not only store the code that produced the submission but also the environment it ran in.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`location` Central
    
      All submissions and their evaluations in one place.

How do I...
-----------

.. grid:: 1 1 1 1
   :margin: 4 4 0 0
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`home-fill` Organize a Shared Task
      :link: organizing-tasks
      :link-type: doc
    
      For those who have train-, validation-, and test-data and want to see how they can be fitted well.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`server` Host my own Instance
      :link: deployment/instance
      :link-type: doc

      This step is optional. If you need a TIRA instance for internal shared tasks, you are welcome to host you own instance. For a lightweight alternative, also have a look at hosting your own *runner*.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`package` Host my own Runner
      :link: deployment/runner
      :link-type: doc

      This step is also optional. This is for you if you want to use an external TIRA instance but keep your test data internal.


.. note:: You just want to try TIRA within your organization without setting up the production deployment? We have created a slimmed down :doc:`demo deployment <deployment/demo>` just for this!
