    This page needs more work. E.g, what do the listed modules do (give a brief overview such that new users know what

TIRA itself is split into 3 modules that have to be deployed separately:

1. The :doc:`Application Module<application>`
2. The :doc:`Host Module<host>`
3. The :doc:`Frontend<host>`
